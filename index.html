  <h1>World Problems: Understanding the Issues</h1>

  <!-- 1. Poverty -->
  <section>
    <h2>Poverty: A Global Challenge</h2>
    <p>Poverty is a complex social issue affecting millions of people worldwide. It is characterized by a lack of access to basic needs such as food, clean water, healthcare, and education. Poverty leads to increased vulnerability and is often linked to other global problems, such as inequality and economic instability.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causes of Poverty</h2>
    <p>Some of the leading causes of poverty include unemployment, poor education, low wages, and lack of access to basic resources. Economic inequality, corruption, and the unequal distribution of wealth exacerbate the issue, leaving many people stuck in a cycle of poverty.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Impact of Poverty</h2>
    <p>Poverty has a significant impact on individuals and societies. It leads to poor health outcomes, limited access to education, and a lack of opportunities for personal growth. In turn, this can create a cycle of poverty that is difficult to break, perpetuating inequality and social unrest.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Ending Poverty</h2>
    <p>To eradicate poverty, governments and organizations must focus on increasing access to education, improving healthcare, and creating economic opportunities. Sustainable development policies, job creation, and social safety nets are essential to helping people lift themselves out of poverty.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What Individuals Can Do</h2>

  </section>

  <!-- 2. Hunger -->
  <section>
    <h2>Hunger: A Persistent Crisis</h2>
    <p>Hunger is one of the most pressing issues faced by millions of people worldwide. Despite advances in food production, poverty, conflict, and climate change contribute to the lack of access to sufficient, nutritious food for many people. Hunger often leads to malnutrition, stunted growth, and increased mortality rates.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causes of Hunger</h2>
    <p>Hunger is caused by a combination of factors, including poverty, poor agricultural practices, natural disasters, and political instability. In regions affected by conflict, food distribution systems are disrupted, and people are often forced to flee their homes in search of food and safety.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Impact of Hunger</h2>
    <p>Hunger leads to severe health consequences, particularly for children, who are more vulnerable to malnutrition. Lack of food can impair cognitive development, increase the risk of diseases, and weaken immune systems. Hunger also leads to economic instability and social unrest, as people struggle to meet their basic needs.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Solutions to Hunger</h2>
    <p>Addressing hunger requires long-term solutions, such as improving agricultural productivity, reducing food waste, and enhancing food distribution systems. Additionally, efforts to improve economic stability and access to education can help address the root causes of hunger.</p>
  </section>

  <section>

  <!-- 3. Lack of Education -->
  <section>
    <h2>Lack of Education: A Barrier to Progress</h2>
    <p>Education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty and improving quality of life. However, millions of children and adults lack access to quality education due to poverty, gender inequality, and conflict. Education provides people with the knowledge and skills needed to improve their economic and social conditions.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Causes of Lack of Education</h2>
    <p>The main factors contributing to a lack of education include economic hardship, cultural barriers, and insufficient infrastructure.

Unemployed individuals may struggle to meet basic needs, which can lead to a lack of housing, food insecurity, and reliance on social assistance programs. High unemployment rates also negatively impact national economies and reduce consumer spending, which further exacerbates the issue.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Reducing Unemployment</h2>
    <p>Governments and businesses must work together to create job opportunities, invest in skills training, and support small and medium-sized enterprises.
